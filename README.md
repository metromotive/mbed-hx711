# mbed-hx711

An MbedOS Driver for the Avia Semiconductor HX711 Load Cell Amplifier. This should be easily adaptable to other environments like Arduino.

Unlike many other open-source drivers for this chip, this driver uses an interrupt on the data pin to allow non-blocking operation, so your device can weigh things and chew gum at the same time. 

## Setup

Connect a digital output pin to the clock (`PD_SCK`) pin on the HX711, and an interrupt-capable input pin to the data (`DOUT`) pin. 

Instantiate an `HX711` with the output pin, the input pin, and a pointer to a function that will be called when a new sample has been read. The callback function should accept a signed 32-bit integer. Note that the callback function runs in an interrupt context, so it's best to either set a global variable with the value or use an event queue when calling a slow or I/O-intensive function like `printf`. 

Once the driver is instantiated, call its `start` method. Several milliseconds later your callback function should be called with a result. 

To power down the chip and stop calling your callback, call the driver's `stop` method.

If you adjust the gain value, the driver will skip calling the callback function once until the new gain value has taken effect on the next read.

### Multiple HX711s

Multiple instances of the driver can coexist, but each must have a dedicated clock and data pin (but see the note in the Troubleshooting section).

## Troubleshooting

The `read` method adds a small delay between clock cycles to keep the pulse width comfortably above the [data sheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/ForceFlex/hx711_english.pdf)'s minimum value of 0.2Âµs. If you have a particularly fast processor, you may have to raise the delay values. With a slower processor you may be able to eliminate the delays.

The clock and data lines are somewhat prone to interference from nearby digital signals. You may want to experiment with shielding, twisting, or physical distancing if you see the occasional spurious value. 

Some boards have an issue where interrupts are shared across pins in a way that's either a leaky abstraction or a bug. Specifically STM NUCLEO boards will need to use different pin *numbers* even if they are on different *ports*, and pins 0 and 1 (regardless of port) did not work for me at all.
